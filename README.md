# MLB_Salaries
In an effort to familiarize myself with baseball data, I've decided to explore a dataset containing MLB Players salaries for my personal project. Join me as I try to uncover patterns, trends, and variables that may influence MLB contracts.

# Data
This dataset was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/maximizing-profits-with-mlb-player-salaries-and?resource=download)
